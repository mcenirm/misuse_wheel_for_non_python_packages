{distribution}-{version}(-{build tag})?-{python tag}-{abi tag}-{platform tag}.whl

* distribution: Distribution name, e.g. 'django', 'pyramid'.

* version: Distribution version, e.g. 1.0.

* build tag: Optional build number. Must start with a digit. A tie breaker if two wheels have the same version. Sort as the empty string if unspecified, else sort the initial digits as a number, and the remainder lexicographically.

* language implementation and version tag: E.g. 'py27', 'py2', 'py3'.

* abi tag: E.g. 'cp33m', 'abi3', 'none'.

* platform tag: E.g. 'linux_x86_64', 'any'.

> For example, distribution-1.0-1-py27-none-any.whl is the
> first build of a package called 'distribution', and is
> compatible with Python 2.7 (any Python 2.7 implementation),
> with no ABI (pure Python), on any CPU architecture.

> The last three components of the filename before the
> extension are called "compatibility tags." The
> compatibility tags express the package's basic interpreter
> requirements and are detailed in PEP 425.

Python Tag

py: Generic Python (does not require implementation-specific features)
cp: CPython
ip: IronPython
pp: PyPy
jy: Jython
Other Python implementations should use sys.implementation.name.

The version can be just the major version 2 or 3 py2, py3 for many pure-Python distributions.

A single-source Python 2/3 compatible distribution can use the compound tag py2.py3.

ABI Tag

The ABI tag indicates which Python ABI is required by any included extension modules. For implementation-specific ABIs, the implementation is abbreviated in the same way as the Python Tag, e.g. cp33d would be the CPython 3.3 ABI with debugging.

The CPython stable ABI is abi3 as in the shared library suffix.

Platform Tag

The platform tag is simply distutils.util.get_platform() with all hyphens - and periods . replaced with underscore _.
